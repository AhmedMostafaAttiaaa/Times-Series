Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build models that can predict the daily sales of Rossmann stores. We will utilize various forecasting techniques, evaluate their performance, and choose the best model to forecast future sales. The project is divided into the following key steps:

Data Analysis
Simple Forecasting Models
Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Models
ARIMA Model
Prophet Model
Machine Learning Models
Model Selection and Future Forecasting
1. Data Analysis
We will start by performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better. This includes:

Loading and inspecting the dataset
Handling missing values
Understanding the distribution of sales
Visualizing sales trends over time
Identifying any seasonality or patterns
2. Simple Forecasting Models
Next, we will implement simple forecasting models such as:

Naive forecast
Moving average
Simple exponential smoothing
These models will serve as baselines for comparison with more complex models.

3. Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Models
We will apply Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS). These models account for error, trend, and seasonality in the data. The specific ETS model suitable for the dataset will be selected based on model performance.

4. ARIMA Model
We will implement the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. This model is effective for time series forecasting when the data shows autocorrelations. We will identify the optimal parameters for ARIMA using techniques such as:

ACF and PACF plots
Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
5. Prophet Model
Prophet, developed by Facebook, is a robust time series forecasting model designed to handle seasonality and holidays. We will fit the Prophet model to the data and evaluate its performance.

6. Machine Learning Models
We will explore various machine learning models for time series forecasting, including:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
XGBoost
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing long-term dependencies
7. Model Selection and Future Forecasting
After evaluating all models using the same evaluation metric as the competition (Root Mean Squared Percentage Error - RMSPE), we will select the best-performing model. This model will then be used to forecast future sales on the test set. The final step involves submitting the predictions to Kaggle and documenting the score.
